# Front Project Manager

## Get started

To begin, run the command `npm install` to install depedencies referenced in package.json file.

Then, it depends on what you want to get :

For development : run the command `ng serve`, this will start a very light node server that will refresh the code at every saving action.

For production : run the command `npm run extract`, this will create a dist folder containing all you need for front production. This dist folder will replace the previous
contained in ../server-Project-Manager/dist emplacement.
